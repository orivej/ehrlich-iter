#+TITLE: Ehrlich iter: in vector permutations for iterate
#+LINK: origin http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2000048/stepping-through-all-permutations-one-swap-at-a-time

=in-ehrlich-permutations= is an iterate clause for iterating over all
permutations in a vector.  Next permutation is always a single swap of
two places in a vector.  See [[origin]] for details.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(asdf:load-system :ehrlich-iter)

(use-package :iterate)

(iter (for i in-ehrlich-permutations "1234")
      (collect i))

(iter (for i in-ehrlich-permutations "1234" destructive t)
      ;; destructive variant doesn't allocate new memory
      ;; hence results must be processed immediately
      (countint (print i)))
#+END_SRC

=in-ehrlich-permutations= is a proper generator: it can be used in
=generating= clauses.  It doesn't support any keywords besides
=destructive=.
